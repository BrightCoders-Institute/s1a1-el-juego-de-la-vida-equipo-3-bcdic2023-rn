## Description.

John Conway's Game of Life is a classic example of a cellular automaton, a mathematical model that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of rules. Created by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life is not a traditional game with players and a goal; instead, it's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input.
